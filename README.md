# C Project : BattleShip

Battleship is a guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which the players' fleets of ships (including battleships) are marked. The location of each ship must be hidden from the opponent. Players take turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the goal is to destroy the opponent's fleet.
